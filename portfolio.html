        <p>I have done a couple of projects which include;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>My first webpage.html</li>
            <p>This webpage is among the many attempts that i have undergone while
               practising to write a webpage it contains basic css syles and proper
               and use of block elements.</p>
               
             <li>sane</li>
             <p>This is my second project,I named it sane because at the time I felt like I
                 was loosing my sanity and being behind the screen helped me contol that. In 
                 this project I was practising how to make commits.</p>
        </ul>
             <h1>About me</h1>
             <h2>Education background</h2>
             <p>I did my K.C.P.E (Kenya Certificate of Primary Education) at Vickmerry Schools
                 after that I proceeded in doing my K.C.S.E (Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education)
                 at BuruBuru Girls' High School.I later joined Technical University of Kenya to pursue a 
                 Diploma in Quantity Surveying.I however,was not able to finish my studies due to financial constraints.</p>

              <h2>Job experience</h2>
              <p>Due to financial constraints I decide to look for a job,luckily I was hired as a Data Analyst
                  mostly due to the fact that I had a bit of computer skills.Before that,I had worked as an Intern
                  at the Department of Urban Development and Planning.
