        <p>I have done a couple of projects which include;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>My first webpage.html</li>
            <p>This webpage is among the many attempts that i have undergone while
               practising to write a webpage it contains basic css syles and proper
               and use of block elements.</p>
               
             <li>sane</li>
             <p>This is my second project,I named it sane because at the time I felt like I
                 was loosing my sanity and being behind the screen helped me contol that. In 
                 this project I was practising how to make commits.</p>
