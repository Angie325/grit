        <p>I am a Mother and a Student</p>
        <p>I have two projects so far which include;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>My first webpage.html</li>
            <p>This webpage is among the many attempts that i have undergone while
               practising to write a webpage it contains basic css syles and proper
               and use of block elements.I used html language.</p>
               
             <li>sane</li>
             <p>This is my second project,I named it sane because at the time I felt like I
                 was loosing my sanity and being behind the screen helped me contol that. In 
                 this project I was practising how to make commits.</p>

             <h1> <strong>About me</strong> </h1>
             <h2> <strong>Education background</strong> </h2>
             <p>I did my K.C.P.E (Kenya Certificate of Primary Education) at <em>Vickmerry Schools</em>
                 after that I proceeded in doing my K.C.S.E (Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education)
                 at <em>BuruBuru Girls' High School</em>.I later joined <em>Technical University of Kenya</em> to pursue a 
                 Diploma in Quantity Surveying.I however,was not able to finish my studies due to financial constraints.</p>

              <h2> <strong>Job experience</strong> </h2>
              <p>Due to financial constraints I decide to look for a job,luckily I was hired as a <em>Data Analyst</em>
                 at <em>CloudFactory Kenya</em> mostly due to the fact that I had a bit of computer skills.I am currently an employee there.Before that,I had worked as an Intern
                  at the Department of Urban Development and Planning.</p>

               <p>I decided to take up software development mostly due to my job.It involves a lot of programming
                   and I knew that inorder for me to get ahead I would have to go back to school and study,I was worried 
                   about the fee especially since it was a time of the pandemic and we had to stop working.Luckily,I came across Moringa School and they
                   had a great discount.</p>
